This project is to analyse a 2012 look sampling of water chemistry at 10 sites in the ACT and NSW in the upland portion of the Murrumbidgee from Angle Crossing to Burrinjuck dam and a few tributaries.

In most plots the Murrumbidgee main stem are the six on the left, tributaries are the four on the right. Both are in downstream (descending) order.
